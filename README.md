**Project Overview**

This project utilizes FDA data accessed via an API to analyze food recalls in the United States. The data is processed using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques and stored in MongoDB for analysis. We will employ various visualization methods, including JavaScript and Python libraries, to tell a compelling story about the recall data.
Data Source.

The data is sourced from the FDA's public API, specifically targeting food enforcement reports.

**Data Processing**

1.	Extraction: Data is extracted from the FDA API.
2.	Transformation: The extracted data is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.
3.	Loading: The cleaned data is loaded into HTML and JS code for visualization.

**Visualization**

We use a combination of JavaScript and Python libraries to create visualizations that help understand trends and patterns in recall data. Some of the libraries used include:

•	Matplotlib
•	Plotly
•	Leaflet


**Planned Visualizations**

•	Introduction – Lakshmi
•	Heatmap showing recalls across the United States – Alyssandra
•	Visualization for the top firms with recalls – Bianca (top cities for recall)
•	Visualization for categories of recalls – Sabrina 
•	Visualization for cities within the top state of recalls – Jose

**Goals**

•	To provide insights into FDA recalls in the United States.
•	To demonstrate the use of ETL processes in data analysis.
•	To showcase various data visualization techniques.

**Data Visualization Track**
For this track, our group will tell a story using data visualizations.

•	The project includes visualizations created with:
o	Python
o	JavaScript 
•	Data is stored in and extracted from MongoDB.

**Ethical Considerations**
We have made efforts to ensure that the data used in this project is handled ethically and responsibly. This includes anonymizing any personal data and ensuring that the visualizations accurately represent the data.
