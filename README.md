Project 3 Proposal
For Project 3, we propose focusing on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, with an emphasis on FDA recalls. Our analysis will utilize a publicly available dataset retrieved from the governmentâ€™s official website: FDA Enforcement Reports API.

The scope of our project includes exploring FDA food-related recalls between January 2020 and October 2024. Specifically, we aim to:

Identify the top states affected by FDA food recalls during this period.
Highlight trends and patterns in the data.
Showcase findings that reveal the 10 states that have not experienced any FDA food-related recalls within this timeframe.
This project seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of FDA recall trends while leveraging data visualization and interpretation to deliver actionable insights.
